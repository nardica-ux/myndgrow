We believe that is contr-productive. Instead - let's think of what WAS DONE. It might be that you have done a lot of small things that fell out of your attention right after you completed them. Yet, adding them to the list will give you moment of appreciation  as well as a bit of focused attention to the goal.`,

It is  hard to stop and think clearly. Here comes the power of visualization - you don't have to think - just open the input form and recall how events of the day added to the progress. Good to play with visuals as well - sometimes we can notice things that are garder to spot without visuals",
