With this effect, educational resources that we have access to nowadays are hard to digest quite too often. this project offers the visual focus on your own self-training`,

Instead here is the overview of what you have accopmlished bundled to where you go. It is great to remind yourself about how much is done!
    We are on the experimental stage - please, feel free to write us about the impression and ideas that came to your mind about this project.`,
